"# demo2" 

This repository is created for giving Demo on GIT & GIT Hub.

Things I did for making this repository.
+ Created a empty repository named `demo2` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
+ Copied the contents from the page and titled as'create a new repository on the command line' and the lines are
```
echo "# demo3" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/AbiramiManikandan/demo3.git
git push -u origin main
